  from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was
  HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility
  when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input
  to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to
  attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.","Checks if a vulnerable version is present on the target host.
