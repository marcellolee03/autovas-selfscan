For each script, I will analyze its ability to address the "TWiki XSS and Command Execution Vulnerabilities" (CVEs: CVE-2008-5304, CVE-2008-5305) by upgrading TWiki to version 4.2.4 or later, which is the recommended solution. The analysis is based on the problem statement that the installed version is 01.Feb.2003 and the fixed version is 4.2.4.

Here's the analysis for each script:

1vt-XssTwiki_1.txt

This script identifies common TWiki installation paths , backs up the existing installation, downloads TWiki-4.2.4.tgz from sourceforge.net , extracts it, and then uses rsync to update the TWiki installation while preserving data, pub, and LocalSite.cfg. It also attempts to stop and start the web server. This directly addresses the vulnerability by upgrading to the fixed version.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_2.txt

This script first attempts to upgrade TWiki using apt or yum if it was installed via a package manager. If not, it proceeds with a manual upgrade process: it attempts to locate the TWiki installation , backs it up , installs curl and rsync if missing , downloads twiki-4.2.4.tgz , and uses rsync to update the installation, excluding pub and data directories to preserve user content. This comprehensively addresses the vulnerability by attempting both package and manual upgrades to the fixed version.



Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_3.txt

This script determines the TWiki installation path , creates a backup , downloads TWiki-4.2.4.tgz , extracts it, and then uses rsync to synchronize the new version, specifically excluding data and pub directories to preserve content. It also attempts to restore the backup if synchronization fails. This directly addresses the vulnerability by upgrading to the fixed version.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_4.txt

This script verifies the TWiki directory and version file , creates a backup of data, pub, and configuration files , downloads TWiki-4.2.4.zip , extracts it , removes the old TWiki directory, moves the extracted new version into place , and restores the backed-up data and pub directories. It also attempts to restart apache2. This directly addresses the vulnerability by upgrading to the fixed version.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_5.txt

This script first tries to upgrade TWiki using apt if it's installed as a package and the available version is 4.2.4 or newer. If not, it attempts a manual upgrade by finding common TWiki locations , backing up the existing installation , stopping apache2 , downloading TWikiRelease04x02x04.tar.gz from GitHub , replacing the old installation with the new one , and then copying back data, pub, lib, and bin configurations. This provides a robust upgrade mechanism.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_6.txt

This script primarily focuses on upgrading TWiki via package managers (apt-get or yum). It checks if TWiki is installed via a package manager and if the installed version is older than 4.2.4. If so, it attempts to perform an upgrade. It also handles stopping and starting the web service. This directly addresses the vulnerability for package-managed installations.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_7.txt

This script finds the TWiki installation , backs it up , downloads twiki-4.2.4.tar.gz , extracts it, and then copies data, pub, and LocalSite.cfg from the old installation into the new one before replacing the entire directory. This directly addresses the vulnerability by upgrading to the fixed version.

Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_8.txt

This script finds the TWiki installation , creates a backup , downloads TWiki-4.2.4.tgz , extracts it, and then uses rsync to synchronize the new version, excluding data, pub, and working directories. It also sets permissions. This directly addresses the vulnerability by upgrading to the fixed version.


Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_9.txt

This script checks for the existence of the TWiki directory , stops apache2 and nginx if they are running , creates a backup of the old TWiki installation , downloads twiki-4.2.4.tgz , extracts it, renames the old TWiki directory, moves the new TWiki into place, and then copies data, pub, TWiki.cfg, and .htpasswd back from the old installation. Finally, it restores service ownership  and restarts apache2 and nginx. This is a comprehensive manual upgrade.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_10.txt

This script ensures it runs as root , attempts to find the TWiki web root , stops Apache , creates a backup , downloads and verifies twiki-4.2.4.tgz (with a fallback URL) , installs the new TWiki , and migrates LocalSite.cfg and .htaccess. It then sets permissions  and restarts Apache. This is a robust manual upgrade with integrity checks.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_11.txt

This script checks for the TWiki installation , creates a backup , downloads twiki-4.2.4.tgz , extracts it, and uses rsync to update the installation, explicitly excluding data and pub directories to preserve content. It then sets ownership and permissions. This directly addresses the vulnerability by upgrading to the fixed version.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_12.txt

This script backs up the old TWiki directory , stops Apache , downloads twiki-4.2.4.tgz , extracts it to a temporary directory , moves the new TWiki into place , and then copies back data, pub, and configuration files (local.cfg, LocalSite.cfg) from the backup. It then sets ownership and permissions  and restarts Apache. This is a comprehensive manual upgrade.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_13.txt

This script primarily focuses on upgrading TWiki via system package managers (apt-get, dnf, yum, zypper). It checks if TWiki is installed via a package manager and attempts to upgrade it. If TWiki is found as a source installation, it explicitly states that automatic patching is not supported. This directly addresses the vulnerability for package-managed installations.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_14.txt

This script stops Apache , backs up the old TWiki directory , downloads twiki-4.2.4.tar.gz , extracts it to a new temporary directory, copies data, pub, LocalSite.cfg, and potentially Plugins and Contrib from the backup to the new version , removes the old TWiki, moves the new version into place , and sets ownership. Finally, it restarts Apache. This is a thorough manual upgrade.


Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_15.txt

This script attempts to find the TWiki home directory , creates a backup , downloads twiki-4.2.4.tgz , extracts it , renames the old TWiki directory, moves the new TWiki into place , and then copies back data, pub, and LocalSite.cfg. It also attempts to set ownership  and restart Apache. This directly addresses the vulnerability by upgrading to the fixed version.




Resolution: Yes
1vt-XssTwiki_16.txt

This script proactively searches for a vulnerable TWiki installation (version "01 Feb 2003") across common paths.
