Port Protocol: tcp
Summary: Systems using Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb), which is available in Ruby versions 1.6
  and later, may permit unauthorized systems to execute distributed commands.
Specific Result: The service is running in $SAFE >= 1 mode. However it is still possible to run arbitrary syscall commands on the remote host. Sending an invalid syscall the service returned the following response:

Flo:Errno::ENOSYS:bt["3/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1555:in `syscall'"0/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1555:in `send'"4/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1555:in `__send__'"A/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1555:in `perform_without_block'"3/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1515:in `perform'"5/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1589:in `main_loop'"0/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1585:in `loop'"5/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1585:in `main_loop'"1/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1581:in `start'"5/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1581:in `main_loop'"//usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1430:in `run'"1/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1427:in `start'"//usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1427:in `run'"6/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1347:in `initialize'"//usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1627:in `new'"9/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/drb/drb.rb:1627:in `start_service'"%/usr/sbin/druby_timeserver.rb:12:errnoi+:mesg"Function not implemented

Vulnerability Detection Method: Send a crafted command to the service and check for a remote command execution
  via the instance_eval or syscall requests.
Details:
Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb) Multiple RCE Vulnerabilities
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108010)
Version used: 2024-06-28T05:05:33Z

Affected Software/OS: nan
Product Detection Result: nan
Solution: Administrators of environments that rely on Distributed Ruby should ensure that
  appropriate controls are in place. Code-level controls may include:

  - Implementing taint on untrusted input

  - Setting $SAFE levels appropriately (>=2 is recommended if untrusted hosts are allowed to submit Ruby commands, and >=3 may be appropriate)

  - Including drb/acl.rb to set ACLEntry to restrict access to trusted hosts

The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 95834

  are reported.
Details:
TCP Timestamps Information Disclosure
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091)
Version used: 2023-12-15T16:10:08Z

Affected Software/OS: TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.
Product Detection Result: nan
Solution: To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line
  'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at
  runtime.

  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timestamps=disabled'

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Timestamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating communication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
