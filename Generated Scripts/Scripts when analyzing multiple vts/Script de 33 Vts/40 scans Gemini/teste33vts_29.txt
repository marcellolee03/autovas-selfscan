# Vulnerabilities 7-9, 13-16, 19, 21-22: Weak SSH Algorithms
# These vulnerabilities require modifying the SSH server configuration.
# The following script disables weak algorithms in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
# It's crucial to back up the original configuration file first.

# Backup the original sshd_config file
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak

# Vulnerability 10: DCE/RPC and MSRPC Services Enumeration Reporting
# This vulnerability is related to information disclosure.
# The solution is to filter incoming traffic to port 135 and the reported dynamic ports.
# This requires firewall configuration, which is beyond the scope of this script.
# Recommend configuring a firewall to block access to these ports from untrusted networks.

# Vulnerability 11: Telnet Unencrypted Cleartext Login
# This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Telnet service.
systemctl stop telnet.socket
systemctl disable telnet.socket

# Vulnerability 12: SSL/TLS: Deprecated TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 Protocol Detection
# This requires disabling TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 in the service's configuration.  Since it's on port 3389, assume RDP.
# This is usually done in the Windows registry (if it's a Windows server), and is beyond the scope of a Linux script.
# Provide instructions for Windows:
#   1. Open Registry Editor (regedit) as an administrator.
#   2. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols.
#   3. Create the following keys if they don't exist:
#        - TLS 1.0
#        - TLS 1.0\Server
#        - TLS 1.1
#        - TLS 1.1\Server
#   4. In each "Server" key, create a DWORD (32-bit) Value named "Enabled" and set its value to 0.
#   5. Reboot the system.
# OR, if this is Linux, and it's some *other* TLS service, the configuration method is service-specific, so it can't be automated.
