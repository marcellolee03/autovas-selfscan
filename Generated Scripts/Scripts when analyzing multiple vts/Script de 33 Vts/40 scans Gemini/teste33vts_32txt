# Vulnerability 1: Proxmox VE EOL
# This script assumes you want to upgrade to the latest supported version.
# It's crucial to have backups before proceeding.
# Adjust the upgrade commands according to the specific Proxmox version you're targeting.
# This script might not work directly and needs proper adjustment for Proxmox upgrade.

# Update package lists
apt update

# Perform a full upgrade (use with caution, test in a non-production environment first)
apt dist-upgrade -y

# Clean up old packages
apt autoremove -y

# Vulnerability 10: DCE/RPC and MSRPC Services Enumeration Reporting
# This vulnerability requires firewall configuration. Example using iptables:

#iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 135 -j DROP #Commented out for safety - enable only if needed.
#iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 49664:49670 -j DROP #Commented out for safety - enable only if needed.
#iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 7832 -j DROP #Commented out for safety - enable only if needed.
#iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 39710 -j DROP #Commented out for safety - enable only if needed.
echo "Please configure your firewall (e.g., iptables) to block access to ports 135, 49664-49670, 7832 and 39710. Check commands commented out in script for example, but consider your actual server environment needs."

# Vulnerability 12: SSL/TLS: Deprecated TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 Protocol Detection
# This fix depends on the service running on port 3389 (likely RDP).
# The method to disable TLS 1.0/1.1 varies depending on the service.  A general example is provided, but adapt for your specific service.

# Example for OpenSSL-based services (Apache, etc.) - adapt for your specific service.
# In /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf or the service-specific config, add or modify:
# SSLProtocol = -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2 +TLSv1.3
echo "Please configure your TLS service (likely RDP in this case) to disable TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1. Instructions will vary on what is hosting the service on port 3389."
