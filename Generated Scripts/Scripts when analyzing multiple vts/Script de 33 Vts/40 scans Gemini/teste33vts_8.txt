# Vulnerability 1: Proxmox VE EOL
# This script assumes the system is running Proxmox VE and attempts to upgrade it to the latest version.
# It's crucial to have a backup before running this.
# This script might not be suitable for all Proxmox setups.  Manual intervention might be required.
# Backups and testing in a non-production environment are strongly advised before running this.
# Note: Upgrading Proxmox VE is a complex task and is beyond the scope of a simple script.
# It is recommended to follow the official Proxmox upgrade documentation.
