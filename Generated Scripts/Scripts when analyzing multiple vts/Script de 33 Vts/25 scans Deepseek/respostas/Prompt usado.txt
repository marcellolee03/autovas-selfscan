(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091)
Version used: 2023-12-15T16:10:08Z

Affected Software/OS: TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.
Product Detection Result: nan
Solution: To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line
  'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at
  runtime.

  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timestamps=disabled'

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Timestamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating communication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.

  See the references for more information.

Summary: The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows
  to compute the uptime.
Specific Result: It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.

The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 221041394
Packet 2: 221041503

Vulnerability Detection Method: Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in
  between to the target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestamps
  are reported.
