    ## CONTEXTO DA VULNERABILIDADE

# Vulnerabilidade 1
CVEs: nan
NVT Name: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information via HTTP
Port: 80.0
Port Protocol: tcp
Summary: The host / application transmits sensitive information (username, passwords) in
  cleartext via HTTP.
Specific Result: Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.
Vulnerability Detection Method: Evaluate previous collected information and check if the host / application is not
  enforcing the transmission of sensitive data via an encrypted SSL/TLS connection.

  The script is currently checking the following:

  - HTTP Basic Authentication (Basic Auth)

  - HTTP Forms (e.g. Login) with input field of type 'password'
Details:
Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information via HTTP
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108440)
Version used: 2023-09-07T05:05:21Z

Affected Software/OS: Hosts / applications which doesn't enforce the transmission of sensitive data via an
  encrypted SSL/TLS connection.
Solution: Enforce the transmission of sensitive data via an encrypted SSL/TLS connection.
  Additionally make sure the host / application is redirecting all users to the secured SSL/TLS connection before
  allowing to input sensitive data into the mentioned functions.

# Vulnerabilidade 2
CVEs: nan
NVT Name: DNS Cache Snooping Vulnerability (UDP) - Active Check
Port: 53.0
Port Protocol: udp
Summary: The DNS server is prone to a cache snooping vulnerability.
Specific Result: Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.
Vulnerability Detection Method: Sends a crafted DNS query and checks the response.

  Notes:

  - No scan result is expected if localhost (127.0.0.1) was scanned (self scanning)

  - If the scanned network is e.g. a private LAN which contains systems not accessible to the public
  (access restricted) and it is accepted that the target host is disclosing information to this
  network please set the 'Network type' configuration of the following VT to 'Private LAN':

  Global variable settings (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.12288)
Details:
DNS Cache Snooping Vulnerability (UDP) - Active Check
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.146591)
Version used: 2025-01-21T05:37:33Z

Affected Software/OS: nan
Solution: There are multiple possible mitigation steps depending on
  location and functionality needed by the DNS server:

  - Disable recursion

  - Don't allow public access to DNS Servers doing recursion

  - Leave recursion enabled if the DNS Server stays on a corporate network that cannot be reached
  by untrusted clients

# Vulnerabilidade 3
CVEs: CVE-1999-0524
NVT Name: ICMP Timestamp Reply Information Disclosure
Port: nan
Port Protocol: nan
Summary: The remote host responded to an ICMP timestamp request.
Specific Result: Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.
Vulnerability Detection Method: Sends an ICMP Timestamp (Type 13) request and checks if a
  Timestamp Reply (Type 14) is received.
Details:
ICMP Timestamp Reply Information Disclosure
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103190)
Version used: 2025-01-21T05:37:33Z

Affected Software/OS: nan
Solution: Various mitigations are possible:

  - Disable the support for ICMP timestamp on the remote host completely

  - Protect the remote host by a firewall, and block ICMP packets passing through the firewall in
  either direction (either completely or only for untrusted networks)

# Vulnerabilidade 4
CVEs: CVE-2011-3389,CVE-2015-0204,CVE-2025-3200
NVT Name: SSL/TLS: Deprecated TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 Protocol Detection
Port: 443.0
Port Protocol: tcp
Summary: It was possible to detect the usage of the deprecated TLSv1.0
  and/or TLSv1.1 protocol on this system.
Specific Result: Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.
Vulnerability Detection Method: Checks the used TLS protocols of the services provided by this
  system.
Details:
SSL/TLS: Deprecated TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 Protocol Detection
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.117274)
Version used: 2024-09-27T05:05:23Z

Affected Software/OS: '- All services providing an encrypted communication using the
  TLSv1.0 and/or TLSv1.1 protocols

  - CVE-2025-3200: Multiple products from Wiesemann & Theis
Solution: It is recommended to disable the deprecated TLSv1.0 and/or
  TLSv1.1 protocols in favor of the TLSv1.2+ protocols.

  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.

# Vulnerabilidade 5
CVEs: CVE-2011-1473,CVE-2011-5094
NVT Name: SSL/TLS: Renegotiation DoS Vulnerability (CVE-2011-1473, CVE-2011-5094)
Port: 443.0
Port Protocol: tcp
Summary: The remote SSL/TLS service is prone to a denial of service (DoS)
  vulnerability.
Specific Result: Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.
Vulnerability Detection Method: Checks if the remote service allows to re-do the same SSL/TLS
  handshake (Renegotiation) over an existing / already established SSL/TLS connection.
Details:
SSL/TLS: Renegotiation DoS Vulnerability (CVE-2011-1473, CVE-2011-5094)
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.117761)
Version used: 2024-09-27T05:05:23Z

Affected Software/OS: Every SSL/TLS service which does not properly restrict
  client-initiated renegotiation.
Solution: Users should contact their vendors for specific patch information.

  A general solution is to remove/disable renegotiation capabilities altogether from/in the affected
  SSL/TLS service.

# Vulnerabilidade 6
CVEs: CVE-2013-2566,CVE-2015-2808,CVE-2015-4000
NVT Name: SSL/TLS: Report Weak Cipher Suites
Port: 443.0
Port Protocol: tcp
Summary: This routine reports all weak SSL/TLS cipher suites accepted by
  a service.
Specific Result: Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.
Vulnerability Detection Method: Checks previous collected cipher suites.

  NOTE: No severity for SMTP services with 'Opportunistic TLS' and weak cipher suites on port 25/tcp
  is reported. If too strong cipher suites are configured for this service the alternative would be
  to fall back to an even more insecure cleartext communication.
Details:
SSL/TLS: Report Weak Cipher Suites
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103440)
Version used: 2024-09-27T05:05:23Z

Affected Software/OS: All services providing an encrypted communication using weak
  SSL/TLS cipher suites.
Solution: The configuration of this services should be changed so that it
  does not accept the listed weak cipher suites anymore.

  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.

# Vulnerabilidade 7
CVEs: nan
NVT Name: TCP Timestamps Information Disclosure
Port: nan
Port Protocol: nan
Summary: The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows
  to compute the uptime.
Specific Result: Vulnerability was detected according to the Vulnerability Detection Method.
Vulnerability Detection Method: Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in
  between to the target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestamps
  are reported.
Details:
TCP Timestamps Information Disclosure
(OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091)
Version used: 2023-12-15T16:10:08Z

Affected Software/OS: TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.
Solution: To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line
  'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at
  runtime.

  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timestamps=disabled'

  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Timestamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating communication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.

  See the references for more information.
